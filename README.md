# ruby_metaprogram

I'm learning Ruby recently and after knowing the basic syntax and some old knowledge about program, I decide to understand more about not only Ruby but the OOP. And from internet I know that _Metaprogramming Ruby_ is a great book. So now I will start this exciting journey.

I will write some notes that I think it's valuable and in case I forget some points.

That's all!
